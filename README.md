# workdayScheduler

## Description of deployed application
This is a scheduler app. It is displays all past timeblocks in grey and future timeblocks in green. I did not manage to get the present timeblock to be red.
The layout and styling was made with Bootstrap, the date comes from Moment.js but I also used the Date object for one of my functions. 
I was unable to figure out how to store the schedule items in local storage in the amount of time given but I look forward to finishing this project at a later 
date.
